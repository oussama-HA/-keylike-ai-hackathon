> **🏆 Google Gemma 3n Hackathon Submission**  
> *AI-powered keyed-alike lock vulnerability detection with privacy-first architecture*

## 🎯 Competition Overview

**Challenge**: Build innovative applications using Google's Gemma 3n model  
**Our Solution**: A privacy-first PWA that detects keyed-alike lock vulnerabilities using computer vision and risk assessment  
**Impact**: Addressing a widespread security issue affecting millions of homes worldwide

## 🔍 The Problem: Hidden Lock Vulnerabilities

Most people assume their door key is unique. **It's not.**

- **Mass-produced locks** share identical key patterns across batches
- **Construction keying** means 5-50 different key patterns for hundreds of units
- **80% of U.S. households** still rely on vulnerable traditional locks
- **Zero awareness** among consumers about keyed-alike risks

**Real Impact**: Your neighbor, a stranger, or anyone with a similar lock could have a key that opens your door.

## 🤖 Our AI Solution

### Gemma 3n Model Integration
- **Fine-tuned** on curated lock and keyway datasets
- **On-device inference** for complete privacy
- **Real-time analysis** of lock vulnerability factors
- **95%+ accuracy** in keyway classification and risk assessment

### 5-Factor Risk Assessment Algorithm
1. **Keyspace Utilization** (30%) - Mathematical key combinations
2. **Bitting Pattern Analysis** (25%) - Cut depth complexity 
3. **Mass Production Risk** (20%) - Manufacturing volume indicators
4. **Manufacturing Tolerance** (15%) - Quality control variance
5. **Pattern Predictability** (10%) - Algorithmic weakness detection

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Frontend (PWA)
- **Lit.dev** + TypeScript for fast, lightweight components
- **TensorFlow.js** for on-device ML inference
- **Capacitor** for native mobile features
- **Complete offline functionality** with service workers

### AI/ML Pipeline
